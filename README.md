# LuaCAD

LuaCAD is a scripting library which uses [OpenSCAD] as engine
to create 2D and 3D objects.

[OpenSCAD]: https://www.openscad.org/

![Simple Model](./images/simple_model.png)

The LuaCAD library creates [OpenSCAD] code
which is then used to create DXF, SVG, or STL files.


## Installation

- Install [OpenSCAD] if not already installed
- [Download the project](https://github.com/ad-si/LuaCAD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Unzip the project
- Create your `<name>.lua` model file (including a `‚Ä¶:export("out.scad")` line)
- Execute code with:
    ```sh
    bin/luacad <name>.lua
    ```
- Open the generated `out.scad` file with OpenSCAD


## Example

**OpenSCAD:**

```openscad
module my_cube() {
  cube(size=[1,2,3]);
}

module my_sphere(radius) {
  translate([5,0,0]) sphere(r = radius);
}

union() {
  my_cube();
  my_sphere(2);
}
```

**LuaCAD:**

```lua
require("luacad")

my_cube = cube { size = { 1, 2, 3 } }

function my_sphere(radius)
  return sphere({ r = 2 }):translate(5, 0, 0)
end

model = my_cube + my_sphere(2)

model:export("simple.scad")
```


## Additional Functions

In comparison to OpenSCAD, LuaCAD provides several additional functions
that make it easier to create complex models:

- 2D Objects
    - `ellipse()`
    - `regular_polygon()`
- 3D Objects
    - `cone()` (can use cylinder with different radii)
    - `prism()`
    - `wedge()`
    - `torus()`
    - `surface()`
- Extrusions
    - `rotate_extrude()` with angle parameter
- Mathematical/Programming
    - Most math functions (`cross()`, `norm()`, trigonometric functions)
    - List operations (`len()`, `each`, `range()`)
- Special
    - `import_3mf()`, `rands()`, `search()`


## Why Lua?

The OpenSCAD language is limited and has several issues:

- Confusing functions vs modules
- Weird variable scoping
- Not a well establised programming language
    - Bad editor support
    - Limited documentation
    - Limited libraries
    - Bad error messages
    - Bad performance

Therefore, a *real* programming language should be used
and it should ideally be interpreted and have good
[operator overloading support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading)

- Julia - Too complex
- Python - Too slow and while easy to get started, hard to master

**‚Ä¶ and the winner is Lua üèÜ**

- Powerful
- Consistent
- Fast
- Well established
- Easily embeddable and could therefore be directly integrated
    into OpenSCAD or a new CAD software
- Similar syntax to OpenSCAD language
- Already used in other CAD software like [LibreCAD] and [Autodesk Netfabb]

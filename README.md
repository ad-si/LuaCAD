# Lua_CAD

Lua CAD is a scripting library which uses OpenSCAD as engine to create 2D and 3D objects (coloring optional).
Supported file exports are: dxf, svg, stl, obj, wrl

The Lua CAD library creates scad code which is then used by OpenSCAD to create dxf, svg or an stl file.
If the object should have a specific color then Lua CAD can take an stl file and convert it to obj or wrl with color.

Main Features:
* using CAD objects
* STL to WRL converter with color
* STL to OBJ converter with color

Installation:
* copy all files to your Lua Home Directory
* Install OpenSCAD if not already installed
* Open the settings file and remove the _ at the end
* Enter correct paths for the settings file
